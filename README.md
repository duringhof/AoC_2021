# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my solutions to the 2021 edition of Advent of Code (or AoC) so far...

## Instructions to build the project

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/duringhof/AoC_2021.git`

2. Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`

3. Build the project: `cmake .. && make`

4. Run one of the resulting executables: `./build/day01` (just pick the day of you want to run!)
